            doctorsClub believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and
            has therefore adopted a liberal cancellation and refund policy. Under
            this policy:
          </p>

          <ul className="list-disc ml-5 space-y-2">
            <li>
              Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made within
              the same day of placing the order. However, the cancellation request
              may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
              vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping
              them.
            </li>
            <li>
              doctorsClub does not accept cancellation requests for perishable
              items like flowers or food. However, refunds or replacements can be
              made if the customer establishes that the quality of the product
              delivered is unsatisfactory.
            </li>
            <li>
              In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report this
              to our Customer Service team immediately upon receipt of the
              products. We will entertain the request only after the merchant has
              verified and checked the issue.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you feel the product received does not match your expectations or
              what was shown on the site, please bring it to the notice of our
              Customer Service team within the same day of receipt. After
              reviewing your complaint, an appropriate decision will be made.
            </li>
            <li>
              For products that come with a manufacturer's warranty, complaints
              should be referred directly to the manufacturer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Refunds, if approved by doctorsClub, will take 1-2 business days to
              process and be credited to the end customer.
